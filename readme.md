Course Project - Developing Data Products
================================

This is the github location where my Developing Data Products Project assignment is stored.
The shiny application developed is a tool to help determine whether a given body temperature is a Fever or not.
In order to use it, just select the portion of your body from where you took the temperature and slide the value observed from your termometer. Click "Submit" to know the answer.
The files of the application are:

* ui.R
* server.R

The application is accesible in: https://fabiomdr.shinyapps.io/DDPCoursera

The presentation of the application designed using slidify is stored at:
